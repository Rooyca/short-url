# Link shortener

A link shortener is a tool or service that converts long URLs into shorter, more compact versions. It takes a lengthy URL and generates a condensed link that redirects to the original URL when clicked. The purpose of a link shortener is to make URLs more manageable, concise, and easier to share, especially in situations where character count or visual space is limited, such as social media posts or text messages.
